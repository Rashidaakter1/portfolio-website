                    <p>I am Rashida Akter. I graduated from Bangladesh University in Applied Mathematics. I have some curiosity about coding and websites. How do those things work, and how can we use some text code editor to build a website? It is fascinating for me. So I started learning from some sources like youtube. Also, I recently finished a course in web development where I learned many things to get to know about modern technologies. This is my journey from noncse to web development. </p>
                    <p>I am a positive, enthusiastic, and competent learner and also have a vast knowledge of web development. I have extensive experience working both alone and as part of a team on often time-sensitive, challenging web development projects that require outstanding creative and technical capabilities and the ability to ensure all work is optimized across a wide range of platforms.  I take my work as a Web Developer seriously, which means I always ensure my skills are kept up to date within this rapidly changing industry.</p>
